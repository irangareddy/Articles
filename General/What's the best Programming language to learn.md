Let us consider each programming language as Car. Each Car is differed by following

- Engine
- Mileage

Same as Programming languages do, each programming language is built for its purpose and capabilities to perform some set of operations. There is no best programming language. Each programming language has its pros and cons.

Now, you have more questions in the head, and its time to Switch.

Here we are finding a Treasure(The language that suits you). I want to make things much more clear likewise I've written in different scenarios and choose one that fits you.

- **Case 0: Before all this should I learn C Programming?**

    It depends on you, Initially, C is only the only Programming that serves a wide number of users so many people suggest you learn that but, It's 2020 I think not mandatory to learn it first. You can freely learn any language as the first language.

- **Case 1: Where and What to Start?**

    In this scenario, I think you're new to programming then answer the following questions to yourself.
    - Have I ever inspired to build or create something?
    - If, what is that area? (like web development, app development, data analytics, etc.)

    By this time I think you have something rolling in your head. Keep it safe. We have Something todo.

- **Case 2: I have an interest in that field but, what should I learn?**

    In this case, you have an inspiration to build something then follow the below steps to find your treasure.

    - Google like this *Which programming languages help to a build __Your Inspiration Placeholder__(app/website)*

    Then know you will have plenty of languages in your hand (don't get tensed)

- **Case 3: How to choose one language?** 

    Here you go with the final procedure to find your treasure. Now you have a handful of languages in hour hand. The language you select should the following characteristics

    Please don't think why I have to do all this, This is your answer when some ask why did you choose this language?

    - Top-ranked in the renowned programming languages ranking websites.
    - Already mainstream and firmly established in the Software Development industry.
    - Popularity is increasing or stable and not sharply decreasing.
    - Does It have a large set of libraries, frameworks, tooling support, and have a large community.
    -  Does It have a demand in the job market with a good salary?
